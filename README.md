# QUANTAID  
**Quantum-Proof Vault for AI Training Data**  
Built for BlockDAG Amazing Chain Race – Further & Faster Track

**One-sentence pitch**  
Upload your AI training data once → it gets scanned for risks, encrypted with math that survives quantum computers, and stamped forever on BlockDAG in under 2 seconds.

### The Problem Everyone Feels (But Doesn’t Say Out Loud)

Your model is only as strong as your data.  
That data is private, expensive, and the #1 thing attackers are coming for.

- Quantum computers will break today’s encryption by ~2030  
- Attackers are already stealing encrypted datasets today (“harvest now, decrypt later”)  
- One breach or lawsuit can kill an AI company overnight (Clearview AI paid $50M in 2025 for mishandling training data)

You can’t afford that headline.

### QUANTAID Is the Shield You Need Today

You keep full control. Everything important happens in your browser:

1. Drag & drop your dataset (any size, any format)  
2. Built-in AI quickly scans for PII, poisoning, and bias risks  
3. Your files are encrypted with NIST-approved post-quantum cryptography (Kyber-1024) — still in your browser  
4. A tiny proof (just one hash) is stamped on BlockDAG forever in a few seconds  
5. You get a green checkmark + a permanent explorer link

No tokens. No gas wars. No trust required.

Your data becomes the most secure asset in your company instead of the biggest liability.


### Why BlockDAG Makes This Possible

- Parallel blocks → sub-second finality for our tiny proofs  
- Already showed 15K+ TPS on testnet  
- Zero speculation, zero drama — perfect for enterprise

### Live on Primordial Testnet Right Now

- Smart Contract (verified): [`0xAbcd...1234`](https://explorer.blockdag.network/contract/0x...)  
- Frontend: https://quantaid.xyz  
- Backend + AI scanner is being setup
